# IoMT-Detection-of-Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder-Episodes-based-on-Arduino-Technology

## Overview

This project is part of the **GEARS Program** at North Carolina State University.

The goal of this project is to utilize Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology to detect episodes related to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by combining Arduino-based hardware and sensors.

## Environment and Tools
### •	Hardware Components:
	•	Arduino UNO
 
	•	Skin Conductance Sensor
 
	•	Heart Rate Sensor
 
	•	Temperature Sensor
 
	•	ESP-01S
 
	•	LED
 
### •	Software:
	•	Arduino IDE

## Poster
For an in-depth explanation, refer to the project’s [poster](https://github.com/ShawnCai223/IoMT-Detection-of-Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder-Episodes-based-on-Arduino-Technology/blob/main/Poster.pdf).

## How It Works
1. Sensors collect data on skin conductance, heart rate, and temperature.
2. Data is processed using the Arduino UNO and ESP-01S module.
3. Anomalies or triggers indicative of PTSD episodes are identified and signaled through LEDs.
